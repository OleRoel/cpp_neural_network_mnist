# cpp_neural_network_mnist
This is a coding experiment to compare speed of a C++ implementation for training a MNIST network against a Numpy/Scikit implementation in a Jupyter notebook.

The original code can be found in the "Code for the Make Your Own Neural Network book" repository here: https://github.com/makeyourownneuralnetwork/makeyourownneuralnetwork

The matrix operations for the training are performed with help of the cblas library http://www.netlib.org/blas/

The MNIST datasets for training and testing the neural network can be found here: https://pjreddie.com/projects/mnist-in-csv/
